The Information Networks alumni survey results from my summer job 2021 at Aalto University Department of Computer Science

- The document was written with Latex
- The survey tool Webropol was the basis for many of the graphs and data analysis
- R programming language was used for some data analysis and plotting certain graphs
- Adobe Illustrator was used to make vector graphics
